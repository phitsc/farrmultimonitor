FARR MultiMonitor plugin - 0.0.0.1 - 20. June 2008

===============================================================================

Description
============
The FARR MultiMonitor plugin extends FARR to work better with multiple monitors. FARR's main window currently always shows up on the monitor you moved it to. With the FARR MultiMonitor plugin enabled, FARR's main window will show up on the monitor that contains the currently active window (usually the window of the application you're working in, and also where you're currently looking at).

Additionally, the FARR MultiMonitor plugin has the option to center FARR's main window on the screen.


Installation
============
Copy all files into the FARR_MultiMon plugin directory (usually C:\Program Files\FindAndRunRobot\Plugins\FARR_MultiMonitor) and restart FARR.


Options
============
- Move FARR to active monitor: enabled / disables multi monitor support
- Move relative: moves FARR relative to the screen resolution, e.g. if FARR is 1/3 from the left on monitor 1, it will be 1/3 from the left on monitor 2 as well, even if the screen resolutions of the two monitors are not the same
- Resize relative: resizes FARR relative to the screen resolution, e.g. if FARR takes 1/3 of the screen on monitor 1, it will take 1/3 on the screen of monitor 2, even if the screen resolutions of the two monitors are not the same

- Keep FARR centered: will center FARR horizontally, as well as vertically, whenever its size changes
- Threshold: will only center FARR when it's vertical size changes by more than a specified amount of pixels
